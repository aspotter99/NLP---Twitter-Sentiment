## Introduction
Twitter users generate huge amounts of data every minute.  Much of that data is aimed at a specific brand or product, but using it to detangle what your users really think can be challenging and leave many frustrated customers concerns addressed.  It is also more difficult to amplify positive sentiment if you don't have a way to quickly identify it.  This project will look at a set of tweets aimed at apple or google and create a model that can accurately predict the sentiment in a tweet, weather that is positive, negative, or neutral.  

## Goal
This project will look at a set of tweets aimed at apple or google and create a model that can accurately predict the sentiment in a tweet, weather that is positive, negative, or neutral.   

## Data Set
This project uses the data from <link>

A cleaned copy of the data is saved in this repo as `data/judge-1377884607_tweet_product_company.csv`.

## Definitions

## Methodology
This project will utilize a supervised classification machine learning algorithm to classify the sentiment in a tweet.
Our final model is <insert>.
    
We are primarily concerned with correctly identifying tweets that negative in their sentiment
    
We needed to make some assumptions about the data for this project, these are as follows:

Our EDA 
    
We developed many visualizations
